# Why this?

This is my aide-m√©moire meant to help me understand and remember how to build a react app. It doesn't need create-react-app. It's just static HTML with React injected into it. Why? Because it doesn't have to be all or nothing with React!

## Note

For other projects not using create-react-app, see [Add React to a Website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html) in the official documentation.
